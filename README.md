## Introduction
This is an optional capstone project from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera.
This capstone project is based on a bike-share company in Chicago, Cyclistic. To make informed and effective business decisions for the company,  I  was asked as a junior data analyst to conduct data analysis. 
To do this, I used "R" to complete the analysis.
