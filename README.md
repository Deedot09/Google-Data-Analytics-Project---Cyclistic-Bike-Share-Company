## Introduction
This is an optional capstone project from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera.
This capstone project is based on a bike-share company in Chicago, Cyclistic. To make informed and effective business decisions for the company,  I  was asked as a junior data analyst to conduct data analysis. 
To do this, I used "R" to complete the analysis.

## About the Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. **Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.**

## Scenario
As a junior data analyst on the marketing analysis team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, I am tasked with supporting the director of marketing's vision of maximizing annual memberships for our company's future success. This involves understanding the distinct usage behaviors of Cyclistic bikes between casual riders and annual members.

With this understanding, our team aims to develop a new marketing strategy focused on converting casual riders into annual members. However, before proceeding, our recommendations must undergo approval from Cyclistic executives. Therefore, it's imperative that the recommendations I provide are backed by compelling data insights and presented through professional data visualizations to effectively convey their importance and potential impact.

## Key Stakeholders
The key stakeholders for this project are:

1. _**Cyclitic Executive team**_: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
2. _**Lily Moreno**_: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
3. _**Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team**_: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. I joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s
mission and business goals, as well as how I as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.

## Business Task
There are three tasks that will guide the future marketing program:
1. _**How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**_
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

For this particular capstone project, the director of marketing has assigned me to solve the _first_ business task. 

## Data Source
The datasets have rider information for two years (2019 and 2020), with each year spanning three months from January to March. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). This is the public data that I used to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes and it is originally stored in separate CSV files organized by the different months and/or different years here.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis and graphical visualization, one can see at a glance that the member riders use their bikes way more than casual riders. On a closer look, one can see how the members use their bikes when compared to casual riders. First, members use the bikes more during weekdays  and less at weekends. While for casuals the reverse is the case, having more usage at weekends and less during the weekdays. Second, on average, casual riders have significantly longer periods than member riders, yet they ride more only at weekends.

Another interesting fact is, that the top starting and ending station for members is at Canal & Adams St. which is a location that is known for businesses and 9-5 jobs. As for, casuals it is located at Streeter Dr & Grand Ave which is known to be a very walkable and less busy place in Chicago and most people are pedestrians or bikers. Hence, casuals mostly use bikes for leisure and other weekend extracurricular activities, while members use them mainly for transportation to and within places of work and to carry out other routine tasks.  

## Key Recommendations 
1. Create different forms of advertisement either using billboards or banners in areas where casual riders mostly book their rides and also in traffic-prone areas in the city. One might even add a special discount every now and then.
2. Based on the analysis, it shows that casual riders use the bikes more at weekends. Due to that, it is recommended that the company offer a weekend-only subscription, and these users can upgrade to a member subscription when they want. Here, both the company and the casual users benefit from this plan.
3. Nowadays, most people are on different social media platforms. Cyclistic Bike company can focus on social media marketing that will focus not only on advertising and attracting casual riders to get a subscription but even get new riders to join. this can be done using either skits, short videos or sponsored ads.
